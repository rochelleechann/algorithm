## Question 1
1. Write a function that checks if an inputted value is a palindrome. The function should return true/false (bool). You can assume that all input will be a string type and lower case.

### `node palindrome.js`
Runs the node.js file locally. Test cases are already delcared in the the js file.

## Question 2
2. Write a function that checks if an inputted value is a numerical range "100-200". Inputted values can be an integer or a string in the previously stated format. The return should be a true/false (bool) value. Ranges should also allow floats (e.g. "100.00"). The range should also be listed as min/max order. Valid values: 100-200, 100.0-200.1. Invalid Values: 100, 200-100.

### `node numerical.js`
Runs the node.js file locally. Test cases are already delcared in the the js file.

## Question 3
What are traits and in what scenarios would you want to use them? 

Traits are mainly useed reduce single inheritance. It is similar to a class, but mainly to group functionality.

## Question 4
This is the movie application. You can reference the separate repository https://github.com/rochelleechann/movie-app.git
